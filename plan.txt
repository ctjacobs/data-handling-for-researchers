Basic points for the data course
================================
* Best practice
* What is data?
* Why is data important?
 - got already, collect, generate
 - meta data, where does it come from, provenance, licensing
 
 
 ...
 
 ecmwf, met office - info about dig data, government reports
 
 * Storage of data - backing up, how and where? Compression, encryption, big endian/little endian, sharing data, cloud, commenting code
 
 * Tools
  - How you use data - computer code or script
 
  - What might you want to do with data - merge, manipulate, generate
 
  - what tools avail - languages (MATLAB, Python)
  - unit tests & regression testing
  - v & v
 
  - Version control systems - team development (github, bitbucket)

* Exercises - generating an account. choosing MATLAB or Python. Here's some data, let's do something with it, and get it into bitbucket/git
